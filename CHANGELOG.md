## [1.1.0] - 2025-07-21

### Added
- **Recipe locking feature** for recommendations - users can lock specific recipes to keep them when fetching new recommendations
- **Image caching system** with hierarchical directory structure for recipe images
- **Recipe recommendations** with true randomness using MongoDB `$sample` aggregation
- Instant loading feedback with spinning wheels when fetching new recommendations
- Dark mode support across the entire application
- Comprehensive test suite with 90% code coverage

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Recipe model extended with cached image fields (`cachedImagePath`, `cachedImageUrl`, `imageCachedAt`)
- Image caching uses MD5-based hierarchical directories (`cache/recipe_images/XX/YY/`) for performance at scale
- Recipe recommendations now support locked recipes via `locked_ids` parameter
- Recommendations button disabled when all 8 recipes are locked
- Recipe retrieval prioritizes cached images over external URLs

### Fixed
- Recipe recommendations now provide true randomness instead of returning same recipes repeatedly
- Frontend TypeScript interface alignment with API response structure (`tags` â†’ `tagIds`)
- Recipe list display after fixing data structure mismatch
- Consistent card heights for recipe recommendations with proper loading spinners

### Technical Details
- Recipe locking system with backend parameter support and frontend state management
- Hierarchical image caching supporting thousands of images across 65,536 directories
- MongoDB aggregation pipeline with exclusion filters for locked recipes
